  Build out some simple corridors
  Finish simple lighting
  Shadows, maybe try differnet techniques, shadow maps to start

Idea for demo
  You are on a spaceship with access to some corridors with some interesting lighting.
  The ship is in an asteroid field which you can see through a window.
  The window could have slight reflections.
  The fallout style terminal idea can be a ship computer.
